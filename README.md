# This Repository is a Compilation of my CS Projects for my classes at The University of Texas at Dallas
A key project to look at is Project 1 in the Operating Systems Concepts Project Folder. This Project required implementing a CPU and memory system with a custom ISA. This has 5 test examples to use to see this CPU and memory system in action.
